Scary



Here is the beginning of a scary story set in the near future:

You wake with a start, your heart pounding in the darkness. The acrid smell of smoke fills your lungs. Sirens wail in the distance as you fumble for your phone on the nightstand - 3:47am, October 19, 2045. 

Staggering to the window, you peer through the grimy glass at the hellish scene below. Flames lick at the skyscrapers, dancing between abandoned vehicles in the streets. Panicked screams echo from all directions, nearly drowned out by the crackle of gunfire. Your neighborhood, once a shining example of the city's prosperity, has become a warzone overnight.

With a sick feeling in your gut, the terrible realization hits you - the brewing tensions between the corporate-sponsored security forces and the rebels have finally boiled over. The meticulously maintained order has shattered, plunging the city into violent anarchy. 

You're jolted back to the immediate crisis by a pounding at your door. Muffled shouts penetrate the thin walls: "Police! Open up or we're coming in!" Your heart races as you consider your next move.

What do you do?

- Comply with the police and open the door 
- Grab your bug-out bag and try to escape down the fire escape
- Remain silent and hide, hoping they move on to the next apartment
