Star Wars



It is a time of great turmoil in the galaxy. The evil Galactic Empire has tightened its grip on star systems far and wide, crushing any resistance with its vast armada of Star Destroyers and legions of white-armored stormtroopers. 

You are a young moisture farmer on the desert planet of Tatooine, toiling away under the planet's twin suns to eke out a meager living. You've always dreamed of something more - of adventure and purpose beyond the sandy dunes of your homeworld.

One fateful afternoon, you're hard at work repairing a malfunctioning vaporator on the outskirts of your farm. Suddenly, you hear a strange sound behind you - a series of beeps and whistles. You turn to see a small, dome-shaped astromech droid caught in the sand, rocking back and forth and calling out for assistance.

What do you do?

- Approach the stranded droid and attempt to free it from the sand
- Ignore the droid and focus on finishing your repair work
- Scan the horizon to see if the droid's owner is nearby
