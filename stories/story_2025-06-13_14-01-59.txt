Here is the starting setting for our story:

The year is 2145. Climate change has ravaged the Earth, leaving vast swathes of the planet uninhabitable wastelands. Sea levels have risen dramatically, submerging many coastal cities. Extreme weather events are commonplace. 

Humanity has fractured into isolated city-states, each fiercely protective of their own resources and populations. Advanced technology is reserved for the wealthy elite, while the masses struggle to survive. 

You live in the sprawling megacity of New Angeles. Once the glittering gem of the West Coast, it's now a grim patchwork of sleek corporate enclaves and crumbling slums. As an orphan in the undercity, you've had to be resourceful to survive.

This morning, an urgent alert flashes across the cracked screen of your secondhand data pad. It's a message from your friend Mara: "Meet me at the old factory - I've got a lead on a job. Could be our ticket out of here." 

Your choices:

- Head to the abandoned factory to meet up with Mara and find out about this job
- Ignore the message - Mara's "opportunities" have a habit of going sideways fast
- Ping your other contacts first to see if anyone knows what Mara is up to



Ignore the message



You stare at Mara's message on your datapad, brow furrowed with indecision. Your finger hovers over the screen, ready to tap out a reply. But doubt gnaws at you, holding you back.

Mara's always been impulsive, ready to leap at any chance to make some quick creds or score valuable tech. More often than not, her schemes end up putting you both in danger. Like that time she convinced you to break into a corporate data vault - you barely escaped before security bots fried you both.

No, you decide, setting the datapad aside with a sigh. As tempting as the promise of a ticket out of this place is, you know you can't afford to take that risk. Not now, when you're barely scraping by as it is. Whatever Mara's up to, she's on her own this time. 

You turn your attention to more pressing matters - checking the toxicity filters on your environment suit and making sure your ration supplies are holding out. Surviving another day in the undercity takes priority over any wild goose chase.

Your choices:

- Suit up and head out to scavenge for supplies in the ruins 
- Reach out to your other contacts to see if anyone has work
- Hunker down in your hideout and hope Mara doesn't bring trouble to your door



Suit up and head out



You grab your beat-up environment suit from its peg, turning it over in your hands to inspect for any new rips or malfunctions. The reinforced fabric is faded and stained, but still intact. You pull it on over your clothes, feeling the familiar weight settle on your shoulders. 

The suit's toxicity filters whir to life as you snap on the helmet, your breath fogging the visor for a moment before the air scrubbers kick in. A cracked heads-up display flickers in the corner of your vision, its sensors scanning the surrounding area for any immediate threats. 

Shouldering your pack, you emerge from your hideout into the noisy, noxious chaos of the undercity. Towering piles of scrap and debris line the alleyways, remnants of structures long ago claimed by the rising tides and left to rot. Scavengers in ragged environment suits much like yours pick through the refuse, searching for anything salvageable.

You strike out towards the ruins of the old financial district. The skeletons of skyscrapers pierce the smoggy sky overhead, their broken windows gaping like hollow eye sockets. Tread carefully - there's no telling what dangers might lurk in those abandoned corporate graveyards. But the potential for valuable salvage makes the risk worth it.

Your choices:

- Head for the nearest ruined skyscraper and start scouring for usable tech or supplies
- Skirt the edges of the financial district, sticking to the less-picked-over areas
- Approach a group of fellow scavengers and see if they have any leads to share
