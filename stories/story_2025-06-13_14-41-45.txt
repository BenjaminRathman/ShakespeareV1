Minecraft



You wake up in a strange and unfamiliar world, with nothing but the clothes on your back. As you groggily open your eyes and take in your surroundings, you find yourself in the middle of a vast, untamed wilderness.

All around you, the landscape is made up of blocky, pixelated elements - from the dirt and grass beneath your feet, to the trees and mountains in the distance. The sun hangs bright in the clear blue sky, casting long shadows across the ground.

As you slowly get to your bearings, you realize you have no memory of how you got here or what you're supposed to do. All you know is that you're alone in this strange, cubic world, and you'll need to use your wits and resourcefulness to survive.

What do you do?

- Punch a tree to collect some wood
- Explore the immediate area to get your bearings
- Dig into the dirt to see what's underground



dig into the dirt



You drop to your knees and begin clawing at the blocky dirt with your bare hands. The soil is soft and crumbly, and easily parts as you dig. 

After scooping out a few handfuls of dirt, you notice something glinting in the sunlight - it looks like coal! You carefully extract the small lumps of coal ore and tuck them away for later.

As you continue digging, the hole gets deeper and darker. The dirt walls rise up on either side of you. After a few moments, your fingers scrape against something hard - stone! Looks like you've reached the end of the dirt layer.

With nothing left to dig through here, you wonder if you should keep tunneling through the stone or climb back out. The sun is starting to dip lower on the horizon, and you still need to think about finding or building shelter for the night.

What do you do?

- Dig deeper into the stone layer
- Climb out of the hole and look for a good place to build a shelter
