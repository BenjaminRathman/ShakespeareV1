Minecraft



You wake to the sound of birdsong and the rustling of leaves. As you open your eyes, you find yourself in a blocky, pixelated world filled with vibrant colors and strange creatures. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting sharp-edged shadows across the grassy landscape.

Rising to your feet, you take in your surroundings. Rolling hills stretch out before you, dotted with trees, flowers, and grazing sheep. In the distance, you spot towering mountains and a glimmering lake. The air is crisp and clean, carrying the faint scent of earth and greenery. 

You realize you have no memory of how you arrived in this peculiar realm. Your pockets are empty, save for your bare hands. A profound sense of curiosity and a hint of unease wash over you as you ponder your first steps in this vast, unknown world.

What do you do?

- Start punching a tree to gather wood
- Explore the area and look for signs of civilization 
- Dig into the dirt to see what lies beneath
