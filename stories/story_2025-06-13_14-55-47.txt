Test



I don't have enough context to continue a coherent story based on the "Story so far" you provided. It looks like placeholder text rather than a specific setting or events I can build on.

To begin an interactive story, please provide a clear starting scenario that specifies the time period, location, and key background details to set the scene. I'll use that information to kick off an immersive narrative where the player is the main character, and present them with meaningful choices that shape how the story unfolds.

Let me know when you have an initial story premise for me to work with, and I'll get us started!
