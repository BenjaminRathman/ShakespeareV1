Star Wars



You are a young Jedi Padawan, training under Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. The bustling city-planet is the heart of the Galactic Republic, but tensions are high as the threat of the Separatist movement looms large. 

As you meditate in the serene Temple gardens, focusing on the living Force that flows through all things, a sudden disturbance ripples through your consciousness. You sense fear, anger, and a growing darkness in the galaxy. Opening your eyes, you see Obi-Wan approaching with a worried expression.

"I'm afraid the Separatist crisis has escalated," he says gravely. "Count Dooku's forces have launched a surprise attack on several Republic worlds. The Jedi Council is dispatching teams to protect key systems and uncover Dooku's plans."

Obi-Wan regards you thoughtfully. "The Council feels you are ready for your first mission, young Padawan. How do you wish to serve the Republic in this dangerous time?"

- Volunteer to join a strike team engaging Separatist forces directly
- Accompany a diplomatic envoy to negotiate a peaceful resolution 
- Investigate Republic intelligence reports to uncover Dooku's true motives
