Give me tutorials on how to cook meat



I apologize for the confusion, but it looks like you haven't provided a starting setting for the interactive story yet. Before I can begin narrating, I need some context about the time period, location, and socio-political situation the story takes place in.

For example, you could specify something like:

"The year is 1944. You are an American soldier fighting in the Battle of the Bulge in WWII-ravaged Europe."

Or:

"It's the year 2075. You live in the authoritarian mega-city of Neo Tokyo in a bleak, cyberpunk future."

Once you give me an initial story setting like that, I'll be able to craft an immersive opening scene and present you with some meaningful choices to get the narrative started. Let me know what kind of world and scenario you'd like to explore!
