Minecraft



Here is the beginning of your story in the world of Minecraft:

You find yourself in a vibrant, blocky landscape, with square clouds drifting overhead and angular mountains looming in the distance. The sun hangs motionless in the pixelated sky, casting long shadows across the grassy plain where you stand.  You feel a strange mix of familiarity and foreignness as you examine your own hands, noting their cubic shape.

As you take in your surroundings, you hear a rustling in some nearby bushes. Suddenly, a rotund pink pig emerges, oinking amiably as it trots past you. In the distance, you spot trees swaying gently, enticing you with their promised wood - an essential resource in this world, as your instincts somehow know.

You realize you'll need to gather materials and craft tools to survive in this strange land. The first decision lies before you:

- Head towards the forest to collect wood 
- Explore the nearby mountains for coal and stone
- Set out across the plains in search of a village
